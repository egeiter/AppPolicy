SMARTBRAIN â€“ TERMS OF USE AND DATA PROTECTION STATEMENT

By using the SmartBrain smartphone app, you agree to the following terms and conditions:

1 PURPOSE OF SMARTBRAIN
The SmartBrain smartphone app is developed by the University of Basel and aims at training
working memory.

2 TARGET AUDIENCE

2.1 FREE USERS
SmartBrain can be used by everyone that wants to train working memory, specifically people that
experience difficulties with their working memory. For this use case, no Study-Code needs to be
entered in the app and a randomized Study-Code will be generated automatically. App users can
freely choose a username to personalize the app experience. This username is stored only locally
on the device and is not transferred to the database.

2.2 STUDY PARTICIPANTS
SmartBrain is intended to be used in scientific studies to investigate the trainings efficacy.
Thus, it will be used by participants of ongoing studies. Study participants will receive an
anonymized Study-Code from the study personnel which needs to be entered at first launch of
the app. This Study-Code is stored locally on the device and is also transferred to the database.
It allows an anonymous storage of the data which can be used for study purposes. In addition,
participants can freely choose a username which is used for personalization of the app
experience.


3 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING SMARTBRAIN
The SmartBrain smartphone app is designed for Android and iOS smartphones.
Minimum required Android version: ANDROID 5.0 (LOLLIPOP)

4 HOW DOES SMARTBRAIN TRAINING WORK?
The app users will have the option to choose from three different tasks that aim to train
working memory. The first tasks trains the auditive component, the second the visual
component and the third the spatial component of working memory. All tasks include distracting
stimuli presented within the tasks. All tasks are adaptive, meaning they increase or decrease
in difficulty according to the user's performance. This allows a training on the correct
difficulty level for each person. The duration of each task can be set individually, so that
the working memory components can be trained according to the individual needs.

5 DISCLAIMER
You use SmartBrain and all its content at your own risk. Neither the University of Basel nor
any other person or institution involved in the development, creation, or provision of this
smartphone app is liable for any direct, indirect or accidental damage resulting from access,
use or inability to use this smartphone app, or any errors or omissions in its content.
